# ClTwitterEbooks
Lucas approved

This application is pretty much your standard run-of-the-mill Ebooks bot for twitter. It uses the [ClutteredMarkovGenerator](https://github.com/wallnutkraken/ClutteredMarkovGenerator) library to generate these posts and the [TweetMoaSharp](https://github.com/Yortw/tweetmoasharp) library to work with the Twitter side of things.
